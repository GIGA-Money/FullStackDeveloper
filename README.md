# This project attempts to reflect a functional web site for a modern restaurant

## Title

**Open Restaurant.**

Learning full stack development, using but not limited to Spring, Angular, HTML, and CSS

* Will make the layout and initial design in HTML with CSS as a primar to learn
* Eventually start building out the back end with spring boot and use PostgreSQL.
* One Day I intend to duplicate the back end and make it with asp.ent blazor/razor, but no commitments to this until the intial.

BIG EPICS:
Project Scope:

* [ ] I want to prodce a simplee Philly cheese steak restaurant ordering site.
  * [ ] I want to be able to add and customize an entree, side, and drink (such as a Texas style Philly Cheese wrap (via Buc-ee's)).
    * [ ] you will land on a simple opening screen with food items that has:
      * [ ] Home, Menue, about
        * [ ] Home contains images of the food and the internal restaurant locations.
        * [ ] Menue contians images and prices of the food with combos suggestions.
        * [ ] About: simple about page, but will contain details about the project
          * [ ] maybe use Lorem word gen for template?

WireFrames/Mockups:

* [ ] Create Wire frames for the CSS to follow.
* [ ] Create for each site type
  * [ ] Home
  * [ ] Menu
  * [ ] About
* [ ] Will put my images of the mock ups in to this project.
* [ ] Will need to refresh and renforce the Grid/Flexbox tools as to lock down the units and the design.

Color Scheme and typoography:

* [ ] Will just use as much open source fonts as possible.
* [ ] Will use Icons from Awesome Font 5.
* [ ] I'll probably copy a color scheme from an existing site, mix match.
  * [ ] will be sure to use CSS variables :root{ --Color1: red;} to re-enforce that.

Style Guild:
