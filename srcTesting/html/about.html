    This is the website for Bob restraunt.

    <br>
    <br>

    Bob makes burgers since he was 2 years old.
    The legend goes that during the depression time
    Bob was broke. So he took lump of meat and put it
    on grill. Some buns and tomato and special sauce,
    made Bob from rags to riches.

    You can use this site to place order, track order
    or learn more about Bob.
