# High-level-View

The app is based on MVC (model-view-controller) architect. The main function of the app is to perform CRUD operation.

The user must be able to view the menu, choose items (that will then be saved in postgresdb), and track order.

# Architecture

  USER ----> API ---> DB

  : Keep it simple and practical


# FrontEnd

The frontEnd or UI is the main page the user interacts with. The main parts are: title, hyperlinks, color-background.

The hard part will be the interaction with database.
